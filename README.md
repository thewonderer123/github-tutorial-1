## Git vs. GitHub
*Git* is a version control system, meaning that its a system that helps track the changes that you make to the files you have. It takes "snap-shots" of your code known as commits, which are saves of the changes you made. Git-hub is where you can post the files and changes of the code you saved. It makes the code "open sourced" which makes it freely available to anyone to access. *Git-hub*, being on the cloud, also makes it easier to code collaboratively with others. It visually tracks the changes that were made to the shared code in different commits (showing what was added in green and what was deleted in red). In summary, Git helps you save and track changes made to your code while Git-hub helps you save those changes on the cloud. Remember, Git can work without Git-hub, but Git-hub does need Git
